# SVG_LOGO_GENERATOR

## Description
This is an SVG generator that creates an SVG logo of either a Circle, Triangle, or Square based on user inputs for shape-type, text, text-color and shape-color.
It generates prompts using inquirer and tests using jest. This project is in node.js. and allows quality svg logos to be generated by this app rather than hiring a graphic designer. During this project I learned to run npm tests using jest and gained more insight into creating classes and sub classes by creating the shapes file.

## Installation
To install this application a user can clone this to a terminal in vscode and in the index.js file open an integrated terminal and type npm install for inquirer and jest.

## Usage
To use this application, first install it. Then again in the integrated terminal type npm i to access the node modules and then type node index.js and this will initialize inquirer to generate the prompts. After answering the questions about text,text-color, shape and shape-color, a svg logo will be generated in the logo.svg file.
## Credits
I did not have any collaborators on this project, but I did receive alot of help from my tutor in two separate tutoring sessions where she helped with showing me the shapes test structure and also on our second session she helped
me get the logo svg to render correctly by demonstrating how the shape  and text sizes and locations could be manipulated in the index.js file. Very helpful and enlightening. h
